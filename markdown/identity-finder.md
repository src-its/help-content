# Identity Finder

## What is Identity Finder?

[Identity Finder](http://www.identityfinder.com/) is a tool to help prevent theft of 'identity' data,[^identity-finder] such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, birthdates, passwords, driver's license numbers, addresses, and passports. It scans can be also be extended and customized for employee identification numbers, maiden names, or other data you determine.

## Why Do We Use Identity Finder?

The software can help protect and dispose of these data (shred, encrypt, or redact) if they are stored on your computer, file shares, or external media (except for data in downloaded e-mail messages).[^indiana-university]

Once Identity Finder has secured all exposed private data, a laptop thief or spying Trojan won't be able to steal your identity.[^pcmag]
