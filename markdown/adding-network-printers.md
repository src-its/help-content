To add a network printer:

1. Go to 'Control Panel'

1. Click into 'Hardware and Sound', and then into 'Printers'

1. Select 'Add Printer', and choose the option for 'Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer'

1. The Wizard will search for available printers (which takes a minute).  For SRC staff, the printers to which we're connecting won't be listed, so click 'Stop' to end the search, and then click 'The printer that I want isn't listed'.

1. The Add Printer Wizard will then ask how you wish to find the printer.  Select 'Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname', then click 'Next'

1. Where the Wizard prompts you to add a printer hostname or IP address, enter in the name of the specific printer to which you'd like to connect. [Note: The names of most campus printers are specified on a label affixed to the top of the device.]  Leave checked the box asking if you wish to query the printer and to select a driver, then click 'Next'.
