1. The Wizard will search for available printers (which takes a minute).  For SRC staff, the printers to which we're connecting won't be listed, so click 'Stop' to end the search, and then click 'The printer that I want isn't listed'.

1. The Add Printer Wizard will then ask how you wish to find the printer.  Select 'Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname', then click 'Next'

1. Where the Wizard prompts you to add a printer hostname or IP address, enter in the name of the specific printer to which you'd like to connect. [**note:** The names of most campus printers are specified on a label affixed to the top of the device.]  Leave checked the box asking if you wish to query the printer and to select a driver, then click 'Next'.

1. When prompted, select the printer make and models and install the appropriate drivers. [**Note:** Most printers on campus will be correctly identified by the Wizard during this step. If not, you will either need to select your printer from a list of options provided by the Wizard, or otherwise choose 'Have Disk' and install the correct drivers.]

Assuming that all went well, then you're all set!
