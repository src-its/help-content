SRC faculty and staff who do not have college-owned machines have two options for accessing Microsoft Office software:

## Microsoft Office 365

Microsoft allows students and educators to use Microsoft 365--the online versions of Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote, as well as 1 TB online storage) for free:

Office 365 is a good option especially for those working on collaborative projects, as contributers can see each other's work in real time. This eliminates problems associated with working multiple file versions. It is important to note, however, that as a cloud-based application, Office 365 required an active Internet in order to access and manipulate a file.


## Microsoft Office Professional Plus

SRC faculty and staff can purchase Microsoft Office software for local (standard) installation for a nominal fee of $10 via their 'Home Use Program'.

Currently on offer are 'Office Professional Plus 2016' for Microsoft Windows users and 'Office Home and Business 2016' for Mac users. [Please note: Eligible customers are allowed to purchase either Office Professional Plus or Office for Mac but not both.]

To purchase the software, you will need to provide your @simons-rock.edu email address:

    http://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/hup.aspx?culture=en-US

Please note that, where you're prompted to enter Simon's Rock's "program code", you'll need to click the hyperlinked text stating, "Don't Know Your Program Code? Click Here." and then press 'submit'.


You'll receive email instructions from Microsoft detailing the purchasing process.
