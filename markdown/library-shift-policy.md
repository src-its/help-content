CA Library Shift Workflow

In order to sign up for a library shift, each CA must commit to implementing the following sequence of activities:

The responsibility for implementing this sequence is entirely that of the CA.

### Step 1 - Schedule a Shift 

CAs may sign up for Library shifts by entering your name and theme into our [shared Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FewlLMx2gZrXYde-QG-gRwZ2wlV0cV4prEB3Aqq_nqI/edit#gid=1715420051).

Consider fun ways to theme your shift to pique the interest of your peers. Avoid generic themes like "Intro to Linux" and try instead to specify particular points, like *"Overcoming Common Linux Installation Snags"* or *"Ways to Save Time Using the Linux Command Line"*.

### Step 2 - Draft a Blurb

After signing up for your theme, you'll need to write a short blurb that gives greater detail about what students could expect from attending your theme night.

Since we benefit by adding a bit of HTML formatting when publishing our theme nights (elaborated below), try to include it when doing your write up. Use the following as a template:

```
<p>
29 Sept. 2015 <br />
<b>@ the CA Table: Become a Linux Command Line Ninja</b>
</p>
<p>
Simon's Rock ITS Student Computer Assistants are hosting weekly thematic discussions on topics in Information Technologies during our support hours in the Library (Sunday - Thursday, 8 p.m. - midnight).
</p>
<p>
Managing files, deploying programs… even editing images: the Linux command line offers absolute power.  Come to the SRC Alumni Library to hone your Linux-foo.  But don’t let it corrupt you (absolutely).
</p>
<p>
Host: YOUR NAME HERE<br />
Location: Alumni Library
</p>
```


### Step 3 - Create a Poster

After scheduling a shift and drafting your blurb, it's time to create a poster.

We need posters in two formats: i) *.gif ([pronounced both /ˈdʒɪf/ **jif** or /ˈɡɪf/ **ghif**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)) formatted to 1920 x 1080 pixels, and ii) PDF format.

It is acceptable to use any form of image manipulation software to create your posters, but as an exercise in working with computer languages and formatting syntaxes, please try to create a poster using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).  **NOTE:** @jfoos has been [working hard to create a script that will auto-generate a poster]()https://github.com/src-its/LaTeX/blob/master/create_poster.py using the [Beamer document class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)). All CAs are encouraged to try her script and to build on her work].

1. Promoting Awareness of CA Presence at SRC.

	* Advertise the CA program rather than individual CA library shifts
	* put posters EVERYWHERE
	* Get on student announces for events in emails
	* inform professors of shifts that relate to their course and ask them to let their students know
	* put it on the SRC website, moodle, my SRC, etc.
