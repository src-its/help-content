CA Library Shift Workflow

In order to sign up for a library shift, each CA must commit to implementing the following sequence of activities:

The responsibility for implementing this sequence is entirely that of the CA.

### Step 1 - Sign-Up 

CAs may sign up for Library shifts by entering your name and theme into our [shared Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FewlLMx2gZrXYde-QG-gRwZ2wlV0cV4prEB3Aqq_nqI/edit#gid=1715420051).

Consider fun ways to theme your shift to pique the interest of your peers. Avoid generic themes like "Intro to Linux" and try instead to specify particular points, like *"Overcoming Common Linux Installation Snags"* or *"Ways to Save Time Using the Linux Command Line"*.

### Step 2 - Draft a Burb

After signing up for your theme, you'll need to write a short blurb that gives greater detail about what students could expect from attending your theme night.

Since we benefit by adding a bit of HTML formatting when publishing our theme nights (elaborated below), try to include it when doing your write up. Use the following as a template:

```

<b>@ the CA Table: Become a Linux Command Line Ninja</b>

Simon's Rock ITS Student Computer Assistants are hosting weekly thematic discussions on topics in Information Technologies during our support hours in the Library (Sunday - Thursday, 8 p.m. - midnight).

Managing files, deploying programs… even editing images: the Linux command line offers absolute power.  Come to the SRC Alumni Library to hone your Linux-foo.  But don’t let it corrupt you (absolutely).

```


### Step 3 - Create a Poster

	* Advertise the CA program rather than individual CA library shifts
	* put posters EVERYWHERE
	* Get on student announces for events in emails
