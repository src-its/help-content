## Building your own website 101:

### Getting your own domain name
 
 When getting a domain name from a registar, there are a few important points to consider:

**GOOD OPTIONS:**
    * GoDaddy
    * Namecheap
    * MMX

**CHOOSING:**
    To best choose a domain name

**BE CAREFUL:**
    * Do not google your domain name repeatedly. 
    All internet searches for domain names are recorded. Some people make a business of using that information to buy the domain you were interested in and selling it to you later. This is called Domain Name Front Running.
    * Use an incognito page. 
    If you look at the price of your domain name close the page and reopen it later it is highly possible that the price of the domain name was raised. One simple way of making sure this does not happen is to use an incognito page and buy the domain on your first visit to the    registar's webpage.

**TIPS:**
    * If you are interested in several domains eg: JJJJJ.com and JJJJJJ.work and JJJJJJ.london a good tip is to buy all of them if you can afford it.
    * A domain is relatively cheap (from 1 dollar to 19 dollars on average a year) it is much more expensive to buy it back from a reseller (they can ask for thousands of dollars). In the long run it is financially wise to buy all the domain names you are interested in and let those you don't want anymore expire.
